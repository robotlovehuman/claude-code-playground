The Basha MCP Playground: Walk-Me-Thru-Guide
The 'Why': From Scattered Docs to an Intelligent Assistant
The Motivation

As a developer, your knowledge is your greatest asset. But where does it live? It's often scattered across project READMEs, personal notes, StackOverflow answers, official documentation, and countless code snippets. When you need to find something, you're often reduced to a simple keyword search (grep, Cmd+F), which fails if you can't remember the exact term you used.

This project was born from a simple but powerful idea: What if you could talk to your own knowledge base? What if you could ask questions based on meaning and intent, not just keywords?

Why We Need This System

We need a way to transform our static, scattered pool of documentation into a dynamic, intelligent, and interactive resource. This system is the answer. It's an AI-native knowledge system built to solve this exact problem. Instead of you being the middleman between your documents and your AI assistant, this system is the assistant, with direct access to your knowledge.

The Core Concepts (A Quick Intro)

This playground demonstrates how to build such a system by combining four powerful technologies:

PostgreSQL + pgvector (The Long-Term Memory): This is our database. The pgvector extension gives it superpowers, allowing it to store and search for data based on semantic meaning. It's the difference between searching for "car" and finding only "car", versus searching for "car" and also finding "automobile," "vehicle," and "sedan."

OpenAI Embeddings (The Translator): This is the AI magic that turns human text into a list of numbers (a "vector") that pgvector can understand and compare. We use the powerful text-embedding-3-large model, which creates a rich 3072-dimensional representation of your text's meaning.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) (The Nervous System): This is the secure bridge that connects your AI assistant (like Claude Code) to your local tools and data (like our PostgreSQL database). It allows the AI to safely call functions on your machine without having direct access to your system or credentials.

Smart Prompts (The Secret Sauce): This is the most crucial insight we discovered. Instead of just giving the AI basic tools (search_docs), we create high-level workflows (like /basha-test). These smart prompts orchestrate multiple tools, analyze the results, and provide intelligent guidance, transforming the AI from a simple tool-user into a proactive assistant.

The 'How': A Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Playground

This guide will walk you through the exact incremental phases we used to build and test the system. Each phase tests one piece of the plumbing with a simple, self-contained script.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

PostgreSQL installed and running.

The pgvector extension enabled for your database.

A Conda environment (we used ai_stuff) with the following packages installed:

Generated bash
pip install openai psycopg2-binary python-dotenv


An .env file in the project's root directory containing your OpenAI API key:

Generated code
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Phase 0: Verifying the Foundation (pgvector)

Goal: Ensure pgvector is installed correctly and can perform basic similarity searches. We use simple 3D vectors to make it easy to understand.

Action: Create a test database and run the toy test script.

Generated bash
# Create the database first
createdb toy_vector_test

# Run the SQL script against the new database
psql -d toy_vector_test -f basha_mcp_playground/toy_tests/test_pgvector.sql
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Outcome: The script will output the results of several vector distance queries. The most important one is the similarity search:

Generated code
-- Test 4: Find animals similar to a 'large, cute, land-dweller'
Query: Find animals most similar to [0.8, 0.2, 0] (big, cuddly, land animal)
   name    |     distance
-----------+------------------
 dog       | 0.14142135623731
 cat       | 0.223606797749979
 hamster   | 0.860232526704263
 dolphin   | 1.28062484748657
 fish      | 1.28062484748657
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Finding: It works! The dog is correctly identified as the most similar, proving our database's core vector functionality is solid.

Phase 1: Connecting to the Brain (OpenAI Embeddings)

Goal: Verify we can connect to the OpenAI API and get high-quality text embeddings.

Action: Run the embedding test script.

Generated bash
# Use the full path to the python executable in your conda environment
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/ai_stuff/bin/python basha_mcp_playground/phase_1_embedding/test_embed.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Outcome: The script will embed three words and confirm their dimensions.

Generated code
=== Phase 1: OpenAI Embedding Test ===
Testing word: 'hello'
  ✅ Successfully embedded 'hello' - 3072 dimensions in 0.98s
...
Expected dimensions: 3072
Actual dimensions: 3072
✅ All embeddings have the correct dimensions (3072)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Finding: We can successfully communicate with OpenAI and generate the text-embedding-3-large vectors.

Phase 2: Storing Real Knowledge (Docs + Embeddings)

Goal: Combine Phases 0 & 1. Store a real document with its 3072-dimension OpenAI embedding in our PostgreSQL database.

Action: Run the document storage test script.

Generated bash
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/ai_stuff/bin/python basha_mcp_playground/phase_2_storage/test_storage_simple.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Outcome: The script will create a table, get an embedding for a test sentence, store it, and verify it was saved correctly.

Generated code
=== Phase 2: Document Storage Test ===
1. Creating table...
✅ Table created
2. Getting embedding for: 'Hello world - this is a test document'
✅ Got embedding with 3072 dimensions
3. Storing in PostgreSQL...
✅ Stored with ID: 1
4. Verifying...
✅ Verified - ID: 1, Content: 'Hello world - this is a test document'
   Embedding dimensions stored: 3072

✅ Phase 2 PASSED!
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Finding: We have successfully bridged the gap between OpenAI and our database. We can store complex, high-dimensional data.

Phase 3: Building the Bridge (Basic MCP Server)

Goal: Create and test a minimal MCP server that follows the JSON-RPC protocol, proving we can expose local Python functions to an AI agent.

Action: Run the basic MCP server in test mode.

Generated bash
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/ai_stuff/bin/python basha_mcp_playground/phase_3_mcp/test_mcp_basic.py --test
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Outcome: The script simulates the back-and-forth communication an AI agent would have with the server (initialize, tools/list, tools/call).

Generated code
=== Phase 3: Basic MCP Server Test ===
...
Tool call response: {
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Hello from MCP! 🎉"
      }
    ]
  }
}
✅ Phase 3 PASSED: MCP server responds correctly!
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Finding: Our MCP server works. We now have a secure way for an AI to call our local Python code.

Phase 4: The First "Magic" Moment (Semantic Search)

Goal: Combine all previous phases to perform a true semantic search.

Action: Run the semantic search test script.

Generated bash
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/ai_stuff/bin/python basha_mcp_playground/phase_4_search/test_semantic_search.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Outcome: The script will populate the database with a few test sentences and then run semantic queries against them.

Generated code
--- Running test searches ---
Searching for: 'greeting'
✅ Query 'greeting' correctly found: 'Hello world, this is a greeting message'
   Distance: 0.3920
Searching for: 'animal'
✅ Query 'animal' correctly found: 'The cat sat on the mat'
   Distance: 0.7794
Searching for: 'coding'
✅ Query 'coding' correctly found: 'Python is a programming language'
   Distance: 0.7303

✅ Phase 4 PASSED: Semantic search working!
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Finding: The system works end-to-end! It can find relevant information based on the meaning of the query, not just keywords. Notice how "animal" found the sentence about the "cat."

Phase 5: The 10x Leap (Smart Prompts)

Goal: Demonstrate the "Prompts > Tools" principle by creating a high-level MCP command that orchestrates tools and provides guidance.

Action: Run the smart prompt test script.

Generated bash
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/ai_stuff/bin/python basha_mcp_playground/phase_5_smart_prompt/test_smart_prompt.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Outcome: The script runs a pre-defined workflow called /basha-test that performs a search, analyzes the result, and tells the user what to do next.

Generated code
=== Phase 5: Smart Prompt Test ===
Testing /basha-test prompt...
🔍 Search Test Results:

Query: 'greeting'
Found: 'Hello world, this is a greeting message'
Distance: 0.3920

✅ Semantic search is working!

💡 Next steps:
- Try: /basha-learn to add new documents
- Search for any topic with search_docs tool
- Lower distance = more similar (0 = exact match)

✅ Phase 5 PASSED: Smart prompt orchestrates tools and provides guidance!
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Finding: This is the culmination of our work. The system isn't just a set of tools; it's an assistant that can run workflows and guide the user, making it exponentially more useful.

What This Unlocks: The Future of Your Workflow

This playground is just the beginning. The tested, modular foundation we've built opens up incredible possibilities for creating a truly personalized AI development partner:

Dynamic Document Ingestion: Create a simple inbox/ folder. Any document you drop in can be automatically vectorized and added to the knowledge base by a /basha-ingest command.

Advanced Smart Prompts: Build highly specific workflows for your needs:

/basha-debug-helper: Takes an error message, searches your knowledge base for similar past issues, and suggests solutions from relevant documentation.

/basha-code-reviewer: When you're working on a file, it can find relevant style guides, best practices, and code snippets from your knowledge base.

Usage Analytics & Self-Optimization: The system can track which search results you find helpful. Over time, it can learn your patterns and proactively suggest documents, refactoring opportunities, or new custom commands to build.

A True Second Brain: This system can become the central, queryable hub for all your professional knowledge, making you faster, more consistent, and more effective.
