# pgvector Toy Test Findings

## Phase 0: Basic pgvector Functionality ✅

### Test Setup
- Created 3D vectors representing animals
- Dimensions: [cuteness, size, water-affinity]
- 5 test animals: cat, dog, fish, hamster, dolphin

### Key Findings

1. **Vector Storage Works** ✅
   - Successfully stored 3D vectors
   - Can retrieve vectors without issues

2. **Similarity Search Works** ✅
   - Cat → Cat distance: 0 (perfect match!)
   - Cat → Dog distance: 0.424 (most similar)
   - Cat → Hamster distance: 0.447 (also similar)
   - L2 distance correctly identifies similar animals

3. **Semantic Meaning Captured** ✅
   - Water-loving query `[0,0,1]` correctly found:
     1. Fish (0.361 distance)
     2. Dolphin (1.082 distance)
     3. Dog (1.118 distance)
   - The ranking makes semantic sense!

4. **Multiple Distance Metrics** ✅
   - L2 distance: Works
   - Inner product: Works (negative values expected)
   - Cosine distance: Works (normalized similarity)

5. **Aggregate Functions** ✅
   - Can compute average vectors: `[0.66,0.46,0.54]`
   - This represents the "average animal" in our dataset

### Performance
- All queries returned instantly
- No issues with 3D vectors

### Next Steps
- Ready for Phase 1: Real embeddings with OpenAI
- Confidence level: HIGH - pgvector is working perfectly

### Commands Used
```bash
createdb toy_vector_test
psql -d toy_vector_test -f test_pgvector.sql
